# About Me
I was born and raised in Venezuela as a second-generation Italian immigrant. Then the Socialist Revolution happened and we had to move again. I came to the United States with my mom and sisters when I was 15 years old. I completed High School and went on to college to study English Literature. I studied English Literature because I'm passionate about the subject and because it is a good prelaw major (it was my plan at the time to study law).

After graduation I started working as a paralegal for a law firm I had interned at during the summers. I was nervous about jumping straight into law school after college because I was not sure I wanted to be a lawyer yet and it was a big investment of time, effort, and money. 

After a while it became clear that a career in law was not for me, and I started exploring other options. Eventually I found programming and fell in love with it. I am very exfcited about starting a career in this field despite not having a technical background.

I still love literature and spend much of my free time reading, mostly fiction. Classics are my jam. Donna Tartt, Virginia Woolf, Shakespeare, JK Rowling/Robert Galbraith, Susanna Clarke, Charles Dickens, Madeline Miller, Gabriel García Márquez, Isabel Allende, and Hanya Yanagihara are some authors I love.
